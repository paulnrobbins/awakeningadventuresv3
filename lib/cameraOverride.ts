/**
 * Camera override registry — small singleton that lets Scene components
 * tell the global CameraRig "go here right now" instead of waiting for
 * the progress-based keyframe lerp.
 *
 * The CameraRig reads `currentOverride` every frame. If it's non-null,
 * the rig lerps toward that target instead of using its progress
 * keyframes. When the override clears, the rig returns to progress
 * lerp seamlessly.
 *
 * This is the cleanest fix for the "1 behind" problem in SceneStay:
 * Lenis's smoothed progress lags behind the user's scroll, so any
 * progress-keyframe scheme will be slightly off. ScrollTrigger fires
 * on actual scroll events, so binding the camera target directly to a
 * ScrollTrigger callback gives instant, perfectly-synced camera moves.

 * scrub feel — the camera would teleport per card instead of walking
 * between them. The override path is now unused by Scene components;
 * camera motion is driven by CameraRig's progress-based keyframes,
 * which mirror these positions one-to-one.
 *
 * Kept exported as the single source of truth for "where does the
 * camera land for accommodation X" — CameraRig consumes the same
 * positions in its KEYFRAMES table, and any new scene that wants
 * the override behavior can opt in via setCameraOverride.
